# Random Tensor Laboratory

## Overview

Random Tensor Laboratory (RTL) is a Python library designed for advanced tensor operations, including various linear algebra operations, diffusion models, and interpolation methods. It is built to facilitate the development and testing of novel tensor-based algorithms.

## Features

- Advanced linear algebra operations
- Diffusion models
- Interpolation methods
- Command-line interface for ease of use
- Integration with Weights and Biases for experiment tracking

## Installation

To install the Random Tensor Laboratory package, clone the repository and install the requirements:


```
git clone https://github.com/tivnanmatt/random_tensor_laboratory.git
cd random_tensor_laboratory
pip install -e .
```

## Usage

### Command-Line Interface

The command-line interface provides several commands for dataset management, model training, sampling, and evaluation.

- **Download dataset**:
    ```
    python random_tensor_laboratory/cli.py download --dataset MNIST
    ```

- **Train model**:
    ```
    python random_tensor_laboratory/cli.py train --config config.yaml
    ```

- **Sample from model**:
    ```
    python random_tensor_laboratory/cli.py sample --config config.yaml
    ```

- **Evaluate model**:
    ```
    python random_tensor_laboratory/cli.py evaluate --config config.yaml
    ```

### Configuration

The configuration for training and evaluating models is handled through a YAML file. Below is an example configuration file (`config.yaml`):

```
dataset: MNIST

training:
  download: true
  epochs: 100
  learning_rate: 0.001
  batch_size: 32
  subepochs: 10

validation:
  interval: 1  # Validate every epoch

network:
  name: DenseNet
  input_shape: [28, 28]
  output_shape: [28, 28]
  channel_list: [784, 1024, 8192, 1024, 784]
  activation: prelu

sde:
  type: SongVarianceExploding
  sigma_1: 80

wandb:
  project: "your_project_name"
  entity: "your_entity_name"
  log_interval: 1  # Log every epoch
```
